<p><div id="About this manual"><h2>About this manual</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="0" href="ciaocoindex.html#status, this manual"></a> <p>This is the <em>Reference Manual</em> for the Ciao development system. It contains basic information on how to install Ciao and how to write, debug, and run Ciao programs from the command line, from inside GNU <a class="idx_anchor" id="1" href="ciaoglindex.html#emacs"><tt>emacs</tt></a>, or from a windowing desktop. It also documents all the libraries available in the standard distribution.<p> This manual has been generated using the <a class="idx_anchor" id="2" href="ciaocoindex.html#LPdoc"><em>LPdoc</em></a> semi-automatic documentation generator for LP/CLP programs [<a href="ciaorefs.html#lpdoc-reference">HC97</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#lpdoc-cl2000">Her00</a>]. <a class="idx_anchor" id="3" href="ciaoglindex.html#lpdoc"><tt>lpdoc</tt></a> processes Ciao files (and files in Prolog and other CLP languages) adorned with assertions and machine-readable comments, which should be written in the Ciao <a class="idx_anchor" id="4" href="ciaoglindex.html#assertion language">assertion language</a> [<a href="ciaorefs.html#assert-lang-ws">PBH97</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#assert-lang-disciplbook">PBH00</a>]. From these, it generates manuals in many formats including <tt>postscript</tt>, <tt>pdf</tt>, <tt>texinfo</tt>, <tt>info</tt>, <tt>HTML</tt>, <tt>man</tt>, etc., as well as on-line help, ascii <tt>README</tt> files, entries for indices of manuals (<tt>info</tt>, WWW, ...), and maintains WWW distribution sites.<p>The big advantage of this approach is that it is easier to keep the on-line and printed documentation in sync with the source code [<a href="ciaorefs.html#knuth-lit">Knu84</a>]. As a result, <em>this manual changes continually as the source code is modified</em>. Because of this, the manual has a version number. You should make sure the manual you are reading, whether it be printed or on-line, coincides with the version of the software that you are using.<p>The approach also implies that there is often a variability in the degree to which different libraries or system components are documented. Many libraries offer abundant documentation, but a few will offer little. The latter is due to the fact that we tend to include libraries in the manual if the code is found to be useful, even if they may still contain sparse documentation. This is because including a library in the manual will at the bare minimum provide formal information (such as the names of exported predicates and their arity, which other modules it loads, etc.), create index entries, pointers for on-line help in the electronic versions of the manuals, and command-line completion capabilities inside <a class="idx_anchor" id="5" href="ciaoglindex.html#emacs"><tt>emacs</tt></a>. Again, the manual is being updated continuously as the different libraries (and machine-readable documentation in them) are improved.  <p></div><div id="About the Ciao development system"><h2>About the Ciao development system</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="6" href="ciaocoindex.html#ciao, global description"></a> <p> The Ciao system is a full programming environment for developing programs in the Prolog language and in several other languages which are extensions and modifications of Prolog and (Constraint) Logic Programming in several interesting and useful directions. The programming environment offers a number of tools such as the Ciao standalone compiler (<tt>ciaoc</tt>), a traditional-style top-level interactive shell (<tt>ciaosh</tt> or <tt>ciao</tt>), an interpreter of scripts written in Ciao (<tt>ciao-shell</tt>), a Ciao (and Prolog) <tt>emacs</tt> mode (which greatly helps the task of developing programs with support for editing, debugging, version/change tracking, etc.), numerous libraries, a powerful program preprocessor (<tt>ciaopp</tt> [<a href="ciaorefs.html#effofai-toplas">BGH99</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciaopp-manual">BLGPH04</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciaopp-iclp99-tut">HBPLG99</a>], which supports static debugging and optimization from program analysis via source to source program transformation), and an automatic documentation generator (<tt>lpdoc</tt>) [<a href="ciaorefs.html#lpdoc-reference">HC97</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#lpdoc-cl2000">Her00</a>]. A number of execution visualization tools [<a href="ciaorefs.html#visandor-iclp93">CGH93</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#apt-disciplbook">CH00d</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#vifid-trifid-disciplbook">CH00c</a>] are also available.<p>This manual documents the first four of the tools mentioned above [see PART I - The program development environment], and the Ciao language and libraries. The <tt>ciaopp</tt> and <tt>lpdoc</tt> tools are documented in separate manuals.<p> The Ciao language [see PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)] has been designed from the ground up to be small, but to also allow extensions and restrictions in a modular way. The first objective allows producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program), providing basic support for pure logic programming, and being able to write scripts in Ciao. The second one allows supporting standard ISO-Prolog [see PART III - ISO-Prolog library (iso)], as well as powerful extensions such as constraint logic programming, functional logic programming, and object-oriented logic programming [see PART VII - Ciao extensions], and restrictions such as working with pure horn clauses.<p>The design of Ciao has also focused on allowing modular program development, as well as automatic program manipulation and optimization. Ciao includes a robust module system [<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciao-modules-cl2000">CH00a</a>], module-based automatic incremental compilation [<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciaoc-ws">CH99b</a>], and modular global program analysis, debugging and optimization [<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciao-modules-analspec-ws">PH99</a>], based on a rich assertion language [see PART V - Assertions, Properties, Types, Modes, Comments (assertions)] for declaring (optional) program properties (including types and modes), which can be checked either statically or dynamically. The program analysis, static debugging and optimization tasks related to these assertions are performed by the <tt>ciaopp</tt> preprocessor, as mentioned above. These assertions (together with special comment-style declarations) are also the ones used by the <tt>lpdoc</tt> autodocumenter to generate documentation for programs (the comment-style declarations are documented in the <tt>lpdoc</tt> manual).<p>Ciao also includes several other features and utilities, such as support for several forms of executables, concurrency (threads), distributed and parallel execution, higher-order, WWW programming (PiLLoW [<a href="ciaorefs.html#pillow-ws">CHV96b</a>]), interfaces to other languages like C and Java, database interfaces, graphical interfaces, etc., etc. [see PARTS VI to XI].<p> <p></div><div id="ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility"><h2>ISO-Prolog compliance versus extensibility</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="7" href="ciaocoindex.html#iso-prolog, compliance"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="8" href="ciaocoindex.html#extensibility"></a> <p> One of the innovative features of Ciao is that it has been designed to subsume <a class="idx_anchor" id="9" href="ciaocoindex.html#ISO-Prolog"><em>ISO-Prolog</em></a> (International Standard ISO/IEC 13211-1, PROLOG: Part 1--General Core [<a href="ciaorefs.html#iso-prolog">DEDC96</a>]), while at the same time extending it in many important ways. The intention is to ensure that all ISO-compliant Prolog programs run correctly under Ciao. At the same time, the Ciao module system (see [PART II - The Ciao basic language (engine)] and [<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciao-modules-cl2000">CH00a</a>] for a discussion of the motivations behind the design) allows selectively avoiding the loading of most ISO-builtins (and changing some other ISO characteristics) when not needed, so that it is possible to work with purer subsets of Prolog and also to build small executables. Also, this module system makes it possible to develop extensions using these purer subsets (or even the full ISO-standard) as a starting point. Using these features, the Ciao distribution includes libraries which significantly extend the language both syntactically and semantically.<p><p>Compliance with ISO is still not complete: currently there are some minor deviations in, e.g., the treatment of characters, the syntax, some of the arithmetic functions, and part of the error system. On the other hand, Ciao has been reported by independent sources (members of the standarization body) to be one of the most conforming Prologs at the moment of this writing, and the first one to be able to compile all the standard-conforming test cases. Also, Ciao does not offer a strictly conforming mode which rejects uses of non-ISO features. However, in order to aid programmers who wish to write standard compliant programs, library predicates that correspond to those in the ISO-Prolog standard are marked specially in the manuals, and differences between the Ciao and the prescribed ISO-Prolog behaviours, if any, are commented appropriately.<p>The intention of the Ciao developers is to progressively complete the compliance of Ciao with the published parts of the ISO standard as well as with other reasonable extensions of the standard may be published in the future. However, since one of the design objectives of Ciao is to address some shortcomings of previous implementations of Prolog and logic programming in general, we also hope that some of the better ideas present in the system will make it eventually into other systems and the standards.<p> <p></div><div id="About the name of the System"><h2>About the name of the System</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="10" href="ciaocoindex.html#why the name Ciao"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="11" href="ciaocoindex.html#Ciao, why this name"></a> <p> Ciao is often referred to as &ldquo;Ciao Prolog,&rdquo; a name which has an interesting (and not unintended) interpretation. Ciao is an interesting word which means both <em>hello</em> and <em>goodbye</em>. &apos;Ciao Prolog&apos; intends to be a really good, all-round, freely available ISO-Prolog system which can be used as a classical Prolog, in both academic and industrial environments (and, in particular, to introduce users to Prolog and to constraint and logic programming --the <em>hello</em> part). An indeed many programmers use it just that way. But Ciao is also a new-generation, multiparadigm programming language and program development system which goes well beyond Prolog and other classical logic programming languages. And it has the advantage (when compared to other new-generation LP systems) that it does so while keeping full Prolog compatibility when needed.<p>  <p></div><div id="Referring to Ciao"><h2>Referring to Ciao</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="12" href="ciaocoindex.html#referring to Ciao"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="13" href="ciaocoindex.html#references, to Ciao"></a> <p>If you find Ciao or any of its components useful, we would appreciate very much if you added a reference to this manual (i.e., the Ciao reference manual [<a href="ciaorefs.html#ciao-reference-manual-tr">BCC97</a>]) in your work.

</pre> <p> </div><div id="Syntax terminology and notational conventions"><h2>Syntax terminology and notational conventions</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="14" href="ciaocoindex.html#notation"></a> <p> This manual assumes some familiarity with logic programming and the Prolog language. The reader is referred to standard textbooks on logic programming and Prolog (such as, e.g., [<a href="ciaorefs.html#SterlingShapiro86">SS86</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#Clome81">CM81</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#apt-log-to-pl">Apt97</a>,<a href="ciaorefs.html#Hogger84">Hog84</a>]) for background. However, we would like to refresh herein some concepts for the sake of establishing terminology. Also, we will briefly introduce a few of the extensions that Ciao brings to the Prolog language.<p><div id="Predicates and their components"><h3>Predicates and their components</h3> <p>Procedures are called <em>predicates</em> and predicate calls <em>literals</em>. They all have the classical syntax of procedures (and of logic predications and of mathematical functions). Predicates are identified in this manual by a keyword &apos;PREDICATE&apos; at the right margin of the place where they are documented.<p>Program instructions are expressions made up of control constructs (<a href="basiccontrol.html">Control constructs/predicates</a>) and literals, and are called <em>goals</em>. Literals are also (atomic) goals.<p>A predicate definition is a sequence of clauses. A clause has the form &ldquo;<tt>H :- B.</tt>&rdquo; (ending in &apos;<tt>.</tt>&apos;), where <tt>H</tt> is syntactically the same as a literal and is called the clause <em>head</em>, and <tt>B</tt> is a goal and is called the clause <em>body</em>. A clause with no body is written &ldquo;<tt>H.</tt>&rdquo; and is called a <em>fact</em>. Clauses with body are also called <em>rules</em>. A program is a sequence of predicate definitions.<p></div><div id="Characters and character strings"><h3>Characters and character strings</h3> <p>We adopt the following convention for delineating character strings in the text of this manual: when a string is being used as an atom it is written thus: <tt>user</tt> or <tt>&apos;user&apos;</tt>; but in all other circumstances double quotes are used (as in <tt>&quot;hello&quot;</tt>).<p><a class="idx_anchor" id="15" href="ciaocoindex.html#keyboard"></a> When referring to keyboard characters, printing characters are written thus: <span class="emacskey">a</span>, while control characters are written like this: <span class="emacskey">^A</span>. Thus <span class="emacskey">^C</span> is the character you get by holding down the <span class="emacskey">CTL</span> key while you type <span class="emacskey">c</span>. Finally, the special control characters carriage-return, line-feed and space are often abbreviated to <span class="emacskey">RET</span>, <span class="emacskey">LFD</span> and <span class="emacskey">SPC</span> respectively.<p></div><div id="Predicate specs"><h3>Predicate specs</h3> <p>Predicates are distinguished by their name <em>and</em> their arity. We will call <tt>name/arity</tt> a <a class="idx_anchor" id="16" href="ciaoglindex.html#<em>predicate spec</em>"><em>predicate spec</em></a>. The notation <tt>name/arity</tt> is therefore used when it is necessary to refer to a predicate unambiguously. For example, <tt>concatenate/3</tt> specifies the predicate which is named &ldquo;concatenate&rdquo; and which takes 3 arguments.<p>(Note that different predicates may have the same name and different arity. Conversely, of course, they may have the same arity and different name.)<p></div><div id="Modes"><h3>Modes</h3> <p>When documenting a predicate, we will often describe its usage with a <a class="idx_anchor" id="17" href="ciaoglindex.html#mode spec">mode spec</a> which has the form <tt>name(Arg1, ..., ArgN)</tt> where each <span class="var">Arg</span> may be preceded by a <a class="idx_anchor" id="18" href="ciaoglindex.html#<em>mode</em>"><em>mode</em></a>. A mode is a functor which is wrapped around an argument (or prepended if defined as an operator). Such a mode allows documenting in a compact way the <a class="idx_anchor" id="19" href="ciaoglindex.html#instantiation state">instantiation state</a> on call and exit of the argument to which it is applied. The set of modes which can be used in Ciao is not fixed. Instead, arbitrary modes can be defined by in programs using the <a class="idx_anchor" id="20" href="ciaoglindex.html#modedef/1"><tt>modedef/1</tt></a> declarations of the Ciao <a class="idx_anchor" id="21" href="ciaoglindex.html#<em>assertion language</em>"><em>assertion language</em></a> (<a href="assertions_doc.html">The Ciao assertion package</a> for details). Modes are identified in this manual by a keyword &apos;MODE&apos;.<p>Herein, we will use the set of modes defined in the Ciao <a class="idx_anchor" id="22" href="ciaoglindex.html#isomodes"><tt>isomodes</tt></a> library, which is essentially the same as those used in the <a class="idx_anchor" id="23" href="ciaoglindex.html#ISO-Prolog">ISO-Prolog</a> standard (<a href="isomodes_doc.html">ISO-Prolog modes</a>).<p></div><div id="Properties and types"><h3>Properties and types</h3> <p>Although Ciao is <em>not</em> a typed language, it allows writing (and using) types, as well as (more general) properties. There may be properties of the states and of the computation. Properties of the states allow expressing characteristics of the program variables during computation, like in <tt>sorted(X)</tt> (<tt>X</tt> is a sorted list). Properties of the computation allow expressing characteristics of a whole computation, like in <tt>is_det(p(X,Y))</tt> (such calls yield only one solution). Properties are just a special form of predicates (<a href="regtypes_doc.html">Declaring regular types</a>) and are identified in this manual by a keyword &apos;PROPERTY&apos;.<p>Ciao types are <em>regular types</em> (<a href="regtypes_doc.html">Declaring regular types</a>), which are a special form of properties themselves. They are identified in this manual by a keyword &apos;REGTYPE&apos;.<p></div><div id="Declarations"><h3>Declarations</h3> <p>A <em>declaration</em> provides information to one of the Ciao environment tools. Declarations are interspersed in the code of a program. Usually the target tool is either the compiler (telling it that a predicate is dynamic, or a meta-predicate, etc.), the preprocessor (which understands declarations of properties and types, assertions, etc.), or the autodocumenter (which understands the previous declarations and also certain &ldquo;comment&rdquo; declarations).<p>A declaration has the form <tt>:- D.</tt> where <tt>D</tt> is syntactically the same as a literal. Declarations are identified in this manual by a keyword &apos;DECLARATION&apos;.<p>In Ciao users can define (and document) new declarations. New declarations are typically useful when defining extensions to the language (which in Ciao are called packages). Such extensions are often implemented as <a class="idx_anchor" id="24" href="ciaoglindex.html#expansions">expansions</a> (see <a href="syntax_extensions.html">Extending the syntax</a>). There are many such extensions in Ciao. The <a class="idx_anchor" id="25" href="ciaoglindex.html#functions"><tt>functions</tt></a> library, which provides fuctional syntax, is an example. The fact that in Ciao expansions are local to modules (as operators, see below) makes it possible to use a certain language extension in one module without affecting other modules.<p></div><div id="Operators"><h3>Operators</h3> <p>An <em>operator</em> is a functor (or predicate name) which has been declared as such, thus allowing its use in a prefix, infix, or suffix fashion, instead of the standard procedure-like fashion. E.g., declaring <tt>+</tt> as an infix operator allows writing <tt>X+Y</tt> instead of <tt>&apos;+&apos;(X,Y)</tt> (which may still, of course, be written).<p><em>Operators in Ciao are local to the module/file where they are declared</em>. However, some operators are standard and allowed in every program (see <a href="operators.html">Defining operators</a>). This manual documents the operator declarations in each (library) module where they are included. As with expansions, the fact that in Ciao operators are local to modules makes it possible to use a certain language extension in one module without affecting other modules. </div> <p></div><div id="A tour of the manual"><h2>A tour of the manual</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="26" href="ciaocoindex.html#manual, tour"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="27" href="ciaocoindex.html#tour, of the manual"></a> <p>The rest of the introductory chapters after this one provide a first &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; introduction for newcomers to the Ciao system.
