This backports an optimization for DARWIN platforms (Jose Morales)<DT><strong>Version 1.14#1 (2011/8/10, 18:17:10 CEST)</strong><dd> Merging r13583 through r13586 (trunk) into 1.14. This fixes problems in the Windows version of Ciao (Edison Mera, Jose Morales)<DT><strong>Version 1.14 (2011/7/8, 10:51:55 CEST)</strong><dd> It has been a long while since declaring the last major version (basically since moving to subversion after 1.10/1.12), so quite a bit is included in this release. Here is the (longish) summary:<p><ul> <LI>Extensions to functional notation: <ul> <LI>Introduced <tt>fsyntax</tt> package (just functional syntax). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Added support to define on the fly a return argument different from the default one (e.g. <tt>~functor(~,f,2)</tt>). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Use of &apos;<tt>:- function(defined(true)).</tt>&apos; so that the defined function does not need to be preceded by <tt>~</tt> in the return expression of a functional clause. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Functional notation: added to documentation to reflect more of the FLOPS paper text and explanations. Added new functional syntax examples: arrays, combination with constraints, using func notation for properties, lazy evaluation, etc. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Added functional abstractions to <tt>fsyntax</tt> and correct handling of predicate abstractions (the functions in the body where expanded outside the abstraction). (Jose Morales) <LI>Improved translation of functions. In particular, old translation could lose last call optimization for functions with body or with conditional expressions. Furthermore, the translation avoids now some superfluous intermediate unifications. To be studied more involved optimizations. (Daniel Cabeza, Jose Morales). <LI>More superfluous unifications taken out from translated code, in cases where a goal <tt>~f(X) = /Term/</tt> appears in the body. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Added <tt>library/argnames_fsyntax.pl</tt>: Package to be able to use <tt>$~/2</tt> as an operator. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Added a new example for lazy evaluation, saving memory using lazy instead of eager evaluation. (Amadeo Casas) </ul> <p><LI>Improvements to signals and exceptions: <ul> <LI>Distinguished between exceptions and signals. Exceptions are thrown and caught (using <a class="idx_anchor" id="0" href="ciaoglindex.html#throw/1"><tt>throw/1</tt></a> and <a class="idx_anchor" id="1" href="ciaoglindex.html#catch/3"><tt>catch/3</tt></a>). Signals are sent and intercepted (using <a class="idx_anchor" id="2" href="ciaoglindex.html#send_signal/1"><tt>send_signal/1</tt></a> and <a class="idx_anchor" id="3" href="ciaoglindex.html#intercept/3"><tt>intercept/3</tt></a>). (Jose Morales, Remy Haemmerle) <LI>Back-port of the (improved) low-level exception handling from <tt>optim_comp</tt> branch. (Jose Morales) <LI>Fixed <a class="idx_anchor" id="4" href="ciaoglindex.html#intercept/3"><tt>intercept/3</tt></a> bug, with caused the toplevel to not properly handle exceptions after one was handled and displayed (bug reported by Samir Genaim on 04 Dec 05, in ciao mailing list, subject &ldquo;<tt>ciao top-level : exception handling</tt>&rdquo;). Updated documentation. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI><a class="idx_anchor" id="5" href="ciaoglindex.html#intercept/3"><tt>intercept/3</tt></a> does not leave pending choice points if the called goal is deterministic (the same optimization that was done for <a class="idx_anchor" id="6" href="ciaoglindex.html#catch/3"><tt>catch/3</tt></a>). (Jose Morales) </ul> <p><LI>New/improved libraries: <ul> <LI>New <tt>assoc</tt> library to represent association tables. (Manuel Carro, Pablo Chico) <LI>New <tt>regexp</tt> library to handle regular expressions. (Manuel Carro, Pablo Chico) <LI>Fixed bug in string_to_number that affected ASCII to floating point number conversions (<a class="idx_anchor" id="7" href="ciaoglindex.html#number_codes/2"><tt>number_codes/2</tt></a> and bytecode read). (Jose Morales) <LI><tt>system.pl</tt>: Added predicates <a class="idx_anchor" id="8" href="ciaoglindex.html#copy_file/2"><tt>copy_file/2</tt></a> and <a class="idx_anchor" id="9" href="ciaoglindex.html#copy_file/3"><tt>copy_file/3</tt></a>. Added predicates <a class="idx_anchor" id="10" href="ciaoglindex.html#get_uid/1"><tt>get_uid/1</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="11" href="ciaoglindex.html#get_gid/1"><tt>get_gid/1</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="12" href="ciaoglindex.html#get_pwnam/1"><tt>get_pwnam/1</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="13" href="ciaoglindex.html#get_grnam/1"><tt>get_grnam/1</tt></a> implemented natively to get default user and groups of the current process. (Edison Mera) <LI>Added library for mutable variables. (Remy Haemmerle) <LI>Added package for block declarations (experimental). (Remy Haemmerle) <LI>Ported CHR as a Ciao package (experimental). (Tom Schrijvers) <LI>Debugged and improved performance of the CHR library port. (Remy Haemmerle) <LI><tt>contrib/math</tt>: A library with several math functions that dependes on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). (Edison Mera) <LI><tt>io_aux.pl</tt>: Added <a class="idx_anchor" id="14" href="ciaoglindex.html#messages/1"><tt>messages/1</tt></a> predicate. Required to facilitate printing of compact messages (compatible with emacs). (Edison Mera) <LI>Added library <tt>hrtimer.pl</tt> that allow us to measure the time using the higest resolution timer available in the current system. (Edison Mera) <LI>Global logical (backtrackable) variables (experimental). (Jose Morales) <LI>New dynamic handling (<tt>dynamic_clauses</tt> package). Not yet documented. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Moved <tt>=</tt> from <tt>iso_misc</tt> to <tt>term_basic</tt>. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI><tt>lib/lists.pl</tt>: Added predicate <a class="idx_anchor" id="15" href="ciaoglindex.html#sequence_to_list/2"><tt>sequence_to_list/2</tt></a>. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI><tt>lib/lists.pl</tt>: Codification of <a class="idx_anchor" id="16" href="ciaoglindex.html#subordlist/2"><tt>subordlist/2</tt></a> improved. Solutions are given in other order. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI><tt>lib/filenames.pl</tt>: Added <a class="idx_anchor" id="17" href="ciaoglindex.html#file_directory_base_name/3"><tt>file_directory_base_name/3</tt></a>. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI><tt>library/symlink_locks.pl</tt>: preliminary library to make locks a la emacs. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI><tt>lib/between.pl</tt>: Bug in <tt>between/3</tt> fixed: when the low bound was a float, an smaller integer was generated. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Fixed bug related to implication operator <tt>-&gt;</tt> in Fuzzy Prolog (Claudio Vaucheret) <LI><tt>contrib/gendot</tt>: Generator of dot files, for drawing graphs using the dot tool. (Claudio Ochoa) <LI>Addded <tt>zeromq</tt> library (bindings for the Zero Message Queue (ZeroMQ, 0MQ) cross-platform messaging middleware) (Dragan Ivanovic) <LI>Minor documentation changes in <tt>javall</tt> library (Jesus Correas) <LI>Fix a bug in calculator <tt>pl2java</tt> example (Jesus Correas) <LI><tt>lib/aggregates.pl</tt>: Deleted duplicated clauses of <a class="idx_anchor" id="18" href="ciaoglindex.html#findnsols/4"><tt>findnsols/4</tt></a>, detected by Pawel. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Added library to transform between color spaces (HSL and HVS) (experimental). (Jose Morales) <LI>Added module qualification in DCGs. (Remy Haemmerle, Jose Morales) <LI><a class="idx_anchor" id="19" href="ciaoglindex.html#prolog_sys:predicate_property/2"><tt>prolog_sys:predicate_property/2</tt></a> behaves similar to other Prolog systems (thanks to Paulo Moura for reporting this bug). (Jose Morales) <LI>Added DHT library (implementation of distributed hash table) (Arsen Kostenko) <LI>Adding property <tt>intervals/2</tt> in <tt>native_props.pl</tt> (for intervals information) (Luthfi Darmawan) <LI>Added code to call polynomial root finding of GSL (Luthfi Darmawan) <LI>Some improvements (not total, but easy to complete) to error messages given by errhandle.pl . Also, some of the errors in <tt>sockets_c.c</tt> are now proper exceptions instead of faults. (Manuel Carro) <LI><tt>sockets</tt> library: added a library (<tt>nsl</tt>) needed for Solaris (Manuel Carro) <LI>Driver, utilities, and benchmarking programs from the ECRC suite. These are aimed at testing some well-defined characteristics of a Prolog system. (Manuel Carro) <LI><tt>library/getopts.pl</tt>: A module to get command-line options and values. Intended to be used by Ciao executables. (Manuel Carro) </ul> <p><LI>Improved ISO compliance: <ul> <LI>Ported the Prolog ISO conformance testing. <LI>Fixed read of files containing single &ldquo;<tt>%</tt>&rdquo; char (reported by Ulrich Neumerkel). (Jose Morales) <LI>Added exceptions in <a class="idx_anchor" id="20" href="ciaoglindex.html#=../2"><tt>=../2</tt></a>. (Remy Haemmerle) <LI>Added exceptions in arithmetic predicates. (Remy Haemmerle) <LI>Arithmetics integer functions throw exceptions when used with floats. (Remy Haemmerle) <LI>Added exceptions for resource errors. (Remy Haemmerle) </ul> <p><LI>Improvements to constraint solvers: <ul> <LI>Improved CLPQ documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Added clp_meta/1 and clp_entailed/1 to the clpq and clpr packages (Samir Genaim): <ul> <LI><tt>clp_meta/1</tt>: meta-programming with clp constraints, e.g, <tt>clp_meta([A.&gt;.B,B.&gt;.1])</tt>. <LI><tt>clp_entailed/1</tt>: checks if the store entails specific cnstraints, e.g, <tt>clp_entailed([A.&gt;.B])</tt> succeeds if the current store entailes <tt>A.&gt;.B</tt>, otherwise fails. </ul> <LI>Exported the simplex predicates from CLP(Q,R). (Samir Genaim) </ul> <p><LI>Other language extensions: <ul> <LI>Added new <tt>bf/bfall</tt> package. It allows running all predicates in a given module in breadth-first mode without changing the syntax of the clauses (i.e., no <tt>&lt;-</tt> needed). Meant basically for experimentation and, specially, teaching pure logic programming. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Added <tt>afall</tt> package in the same line as <tt>bf/bfall</tt> (very useful!). (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Improved documentation of <tt>bf</tt> and <tt>af</tt> packages. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Added partial commons-style dialect support, including dialect flag. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI><tt>yap_compat</tt> and <tt>commons_compat</tt> compatibility packages (for Yap and Prolog Commons dialects). (Jose Morales) <LI><tt>argnames</tt> package: enhanced to allow argument name resolution at runtime. (Jose Morales) <LI>A package for conditional compilation of code (<tt>:- use_package(condcomp)</tt>). (Jose Morales) </ul> <p><LI>Extensions for parallelism (And-Prolog): <ul> <LI>Low-level support for andprolog library has been taken out of the engine and moved to <tt>library/apll</tt> in a similar way as the sockets library. We are planning to reduce the size of the actual engine further, by taking some components out of engine, such as locks, in future releases. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Improved support for deterministic parallel goals, including some bug fixes. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Goal stack definition added to the engine. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>And-parallel code and the definition of goal stacks in the engine are now wrapped with conditionals (via <tt>AND_PARALLEL_EXECUTION</tt> variable), to avoid the machinery necessary to run programs in parallel affects in any case the sequential execution. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Stack expansion supported when more than one agent is present in the execution of parallel deterministic programs. This feature is still in experimental. Support for stack expansion in nondeterministic benchmarks will be added in a future release. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Support for stack unwinding in deterministic parallel programs, via <tt>metachoice</tt>/<tt>metacut</tt>. However, garbage collection in parallel programs is still unsupported. We are planning to include support for it in a future release. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Backward execution of nondeterministic parallel goals made via events, without speculation and continuation join. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Improved agents support. New primitives included that aim at increasing the flexibility of creation and management of agents. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Agents synchronization is done now by using locks, instead of using <tt>assertz</tt>/<tt>retract</tt>, to improve efficiency in the execution of parallel programs. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Optimized version of <tt>call/1</tt> to invoke deterministic goals in parallel has been added (<tt>call_handler_det/1</tt>). (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Optimization: locks/<tt>new_atom</tt> only created when the goal is stolen by other process, and not when this is pushed on to the <tt>goal_stack</tt>. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Integration with the new annotation algorithms supported by CiaoPP, both with and without preservation of the order of the solutions. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>New set of examples added to the <tt>andprolog</tt> library. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Several bug fixes to remove some cases in execution of parallel code in which races could appear. (Amadeo Casas) <LI><tt>andprolog_rt:&amp;</tt> by <tt>par_rt:&amp;</tt> have been moved to <tt>native_builtin</tt> (Amadeo Casas) <LI><tt>indep/1</tt> and <tt>indep/2</tt> have been moved to <tt>native_props</tt>, as <tt>ground/1</tt>, <tt>var/1</tt>, etc. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Added assertions to the <tt>library/apll</tt> and <tt>library/andprolog</tt> libraries. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Removed clauses in <tt>pretty_print</tt> for the <tt>&amp;&gt;/2</tt> and <tt>&lt;&amp;/1</tt> operators. (Amadeo Casas) <LI>Shorter code for <tt>&lt;&amp; / 1</tt> and <tt>&lt;&amp;! / 1</tt> (Manuel Carro) <LI>Trying to solve some problems when resetting WAM pointers (Manuel Carro) <LI>Better code to clean the stacks (Manuel Carro) </ul> <p><LI>Improvements to foreign (C language) interface: <ul> <LI>Better support for cygwin and handling of dll libraries in Windows. Now usage of external dll libraries are supported in Windows under cygwin. (Edison Mera) <LI>Improvements to documentation of foreign interface (examples). (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Allow reentrant calls from Prolog to C and then from C to Prolog. (Jose Morales) <LI>Fix bug that prevented <tt>ciaoc -c MODULE</tt> from generating dynamic <tt>.so</tt> libraries files. (Jose Morales) <LI>Fix bug that prevented <tt>ciaoc MODULE &amp;&amp; rm MODULE &amp;&amp; ciaoc MODULE</tt> from emitting correct executables (previously, dynamic <tt>.so</tt> libraries files where ignored in executable recompilations when only the main file was missing). (Jose Morales) </ul> <p><LI>Run-Time Checking and Unit Tests: <ul> <LI>Added support to perfom run-time checking of assertions and predicates outside <a class="idx_anchor" id="21" href="ciaoglindex.html#ciaopp"><tt>ciaopp</tt></a> (see the documentation for more details). In addition to those already available, the new properties that can be run-time checked are: <tt>exception/1</tt>, <tt>exception/2</tt>, <tt>no_exception/1</tt>, <tt>no_exception/2</tt>, <tt>user_output/2</tt>, <tt>solutions/2</tt>, <tt>num_solutions/2</tt>, <tt>no_signal/1</tt>, <tt>no_signal/2</tt>, <tt>signal/1</tt>, <tt>signal/2</tt>, <tt>signals/2</tt>, <tt>throws/2</tt>. See library <tt>assertions/native_props.pl</tt> (Edison Mera) <LI>Added support for testing via the <a class="idx_anchor" id="22" href="ciaoglindex.html#unittest"><tt>unittest</tt></a> library. Documentation available at <tt>library(unittest(unittest_doc))</tt>. (Edison Mera) </ul> <p><LI>Profiling: <ul> <LI>Improved profiler, now it is cost center-based and works together with the run-time checking machinery in order to also validate execution time-related properties. (Edison Mera) <LI>A tool for automatic bottleneck detection has been developed, which is able to point at the predicates responsible of lack of performance in a program. (Edison Mera) <LI>Improved profiler documentation. (Manuel Hermenegildo) </ul> <p><LI>Debugger enhancements: <ul> <LI>Added the flag <tt>check_cycles</tt> to control whether the debugger takes care of cyclic terms while displaying goals. The rationale is that to check for cyclic terms may lead to very high response times when having big terms. By default the flag is in off, which implies that a cyclic term in the execution could cause infinite loops (but otherwise the debugger is much more speedy). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Show the variable names instead of underscores with numbers. Added option <tt>v</tt> to show the variables list. Added <tt>v &lt;N&gt;</tt> option, where <tt>N</tt> is the <tt>Name</tt> of the variable you like to watch (experimental). (Edison Mera) <LI>Distinguish between program variables and compiler-introduced variables. Show variables modified in the current goal. (Edison Mera) <LI><tt>debug_mode</tt> does not leave useless choicepoints (Jose Morales) </ul> <p><LI>Emacs mode: <ul> <LI>Made ciao mode NOT ask by default if one wants to set up version control when first saving a file. This makes more sense if using other version control systems and probably in any case (several users had asked for this). There is a global customizable variable (which appears in the LPdoc area) which can be set to revert to the old behaviour. Updated the manual accordingly. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Added possibility of chosing which emacs Ciao should use during compilation, by LPdoc, etc. Previously only a default emacs was used which is not always the right thing, specially, e.g., in Mac OS X, where the latest/right emacs may not even be in the paths. Other minor typos etc. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Moved the version control menu entries to the LPdoc menu. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Updated highlighting for new functional syntax, unit tests, and all other new features. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Completed CiaoPP-java environment (menus, buttons, etc.) and automated loading when visiting Java files (still through hand modification of .emacs). CiaoPP help (e.g., for properties) now also available in Java mode. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Changes to graphical interface to adapt better to current functionality of CiaoPP option browser. Also some minor aesthetic changes. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Various changes and fixes to adapt to emacs-22/23 lisp. In particular, fixed cursor error in emacs 23 in Ciao shell (from Emilio Gallego). Also fixed prompt in ciaopp and LPdoc buffers for emacs 23. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Unified several versions of the Ciao emacs mode (including the one with the experimental toolbar in xemacs) that had diverged. Sorely needed to be able to make progress without duplication. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>New version of ciao.el supporting tool bar in xemacs and also, and perhaps more importantly, in newer emacsen (&gt;= 22), where it previously did not work either. New icons with opaque background for xemacs tool bar. (Manuel Hermenegildo) <LI>Using <tt>key-description</tt> instead of a combination of <tt>text-char-description</tt> and <tt>string-to-char</tt>. This fixes a bug in the Ciao Emacs Mode when running in emacs 23, that shows wrong descriptions for <tt>M-...</tt> key bindings. The new code runs correctly in emacs 21 and 22. (Jose Morales) <LI>Coloring strings before functional calls and <tt>0&apos;</tt> characters (strings like <tt>&quot;~w&quot;</tt> were colored incorrectly) (Jose Morales) <LI><tt>@begin{verbatim}</tt> and <tt>@include</tt> colored as LPdoc commands only inside LPdoc comments. (Jose Morales) <LI>Fixed colors for dark backgrounds (workaround to avoid a bug in emacs) (Jose Morales) <LI>Added an automatic indenter (contrib/plindent) and formatting tool, under emacs you can invoque it using the keyword <tt>C-c I</tt> in the current buffer containing your prolog source. (Edison Mera) </ul> <p><LI>Packaging and distribution: <ul> <LI>User-friendly, binary installers for several systems are now generated regularly and automatically: Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora/RedHat, Windows (XP, Vista, 7) and MacOSX. (Edison Mera, Remy Haemmerle) </ul> <p><LI>Improvements in Ciao toplevel: <ul> <LI>Introduced <tt>check_cycles</tt> <tt>prolog_flag</tt> which controls whether the toplevel handles or not cyclic terms. Flag is set to false by default (cycles not detected and handled) in order to speed up responses. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Modified <a class="idx_anchor" id="23" href="ciaoglindex.html#valid_solution/2"><tt>valid_solution/2</tt></a> so that it asks no question when there are no pending choice points and the <tt>prompt_alternatives_no_bindings</tt> prolog flag is on. (Jose Morales) <LI>Now &apos;Y&apos; can be used as well as &apos;y&apos; to accept a solution of a query. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Added newline before <tt>true</tt> when displaying empty solutions. (Jose Morales) <LI>Multifile declarations of packages used by the toplevel were not properly handled. Fixed. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Fixed bug in output of bindings when current output changed. <LI>Changes so that including files in the toplevel (or loading packages) does not invoke an expansion of the ending end_of_file. This makes sense because the toplevel code is never completed, and thus no cleanup code of translations is invoked. (Daniel Cabeza) </ul> <p><LI>Compiler enhancements and bug fixes: <ul> <LI>Added a command line option to <tt>ciaoc</tt> for generating code with runtime checks. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Now the compiler reads assertions by default (when using the assertion package), and verifies their syntax. (Edison Mera) <LI>Added option <tt>-w</tt> to <tt>ciaoc</tt> compiler to generate the WAM code of the specified prolog files. (Edison Mera) <LI>Fixed bug in exemaker: now when <a class="idx_anchor" id="24" href="ciaoglindex.html#main/0"><tt>main/0</tt></a> and <a class="idx_anchor" id="25" href="ciaoglindex.html#main/1"><tt>main/1</tt></a> exists, <a class="idx_anchor" id="26" href="ciaoglindex.html#main/0"><tt>main/0</tt></a> is always the program entry (before in modules either could be). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Fixed bug: when compiling a file, if an imported file had no itf and it used the redefining declaration, the declaration was forgotten between the reading of the imported file (to get its interface) and its later compilation. By now those declarations are never forgotten, but perhaps it could be done better. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>The unloading of files kept some data related to them, which caused in some cases errors or warnings regarding module redefinitions. Now this is fixed. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Undefined predicate warnings also for predicate calls qualified with current module (bug detected by Pawel Pietrzak). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Fixed bug <tt>debugger_include</tt> (that is, now a change in a file included from a module which is debugged is detected when the module is reloaded). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Fixed <tt>a(B) :- _=B, b, c(B)</tt> bug in compilation of unification. (Jose Morales) </ul> <p><LI>Improving general support for language extensions: <ul> <LI>Every package starts with &apos;<tt>:- package(...)</tt>&apos; declaration now. This allows a clear distinction between packages, modules, and files that are just included; all of them using the same <tt>.pl</tt> extension. (Jose Morales) <LI>Added priority in syntax translations. Users are not required to know the details of translations in order to use them (experimental: the the correct order for all the Ciao packages is still not fixed) (Jose Morales) <LI>Now the initialization of sentence translations is done in the translation package, when they are added. In this way, previous active translations cannot affect the initialization of new translations, and initializations are not started each time a new sentence translation is added. Additionally, now the initialization of sentence translations in the toplevel is done (there was a bug). (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Added <tt>addterm(Meta)</tt> meta-data specification for the implementation of the changes to provide a correct <a class="idx_anchor" id="27" href="ciaoglindex.html#clause/2"><tt>clause/2</tt></a> predicate. (Daniel Cabeza) <LI>Generalized <tt>addmodule</tt> meta-data specification to <tt>addmodule(Meta)</tt>, <tt>addmodule</tt> is now an alias for <tt>addmodule(?)</tt>. Needed for the implementation of the changes to provide a correct <a class="idx_anchor" id="28" href="ciaoglindex.html#clause/2"><tt>clause/2</tt></a> predicate. (Daniel Cabeza) </ul> <p><LI>Improvements to system assertions: <ul> <LI>Added regtype <a class="idx_anchor" id="29" href="ciaoglindex.html#basic_props:num_code/1"><tt>basic_props:num_code/1</tt></a> and more assertions to <tt>basic_props.pl</tt> (German Puebla) <LI>Added trust assertion for <a class="idx_anchor" id="30" href="ciaoglindex.html#atomic_basic:number_codes/2"><tt>atomic_basic:number_codes/2</tt></a> in order to have more accurate analysis info (first argument a number and second argument is a list of num_codes) (German Puebla) <LI>Added some more binding insensitivity assertions in <tt>basic_props.pl</tt> (German Puebla) <LI>Added the <a class="idx_anchor" id="31" href="ciaoglindex.html#basic_props:filter/2"><tt>basic_props:filter/2</tt></a> property which is used at the global control level in order to guarantee termination. (German Puebla) <LI>Added <tt>equiv</tt> assertion for <a class="idx_anchor" id="32" href="ciaoglindex.html#basiccontrol:fail/0"><tt>basiccontrol:fail/0</tt></a> (German Puebla) <LI>Modified eval assertion so that partial evaluation does not loop with ill-typed, semi-instantiated calls to <a class="idx_anchor" id="33" href="ciaoglindex.html#is/2"><tt>is/2</tt></a> (this problem was reported some time ago) (German Puebla) <LI>Replaced <tt>true</tt> assertions for arithmetic predicates with <tt>trust</tt> assertions (<tt>arithmetic.pl</tt>).

Improved tracking of errors. <LI>Specific tool bar now available, with icons for main fuctions (works from emacs 21.1 on). Also, other minor adaptations for working with emacs 21.1 and later. <LI>Debugger faces are now locally defined (and better customization). This also improves comtability with xemacs (which has different faces). <LI>Direct access to a common use of the preprocessor (checking modes/types and locating errors) from toolbar. <LI>Inferior modes for Ciao and CiaoPP improved: contextual help turned on by default. <LI>Fixes to set-query. Also, previous query now appears in prompt. <LI>Improved behaviour of stored query. <LI>Improved behaviour of recentering, finding errors, etc. <LI>Wait for prompt has better termination characteristics. <LI>Added new interactive entry points (M-x): ciao, prolog, ciaopp. <LI>Better tracking of last inferior buffer used. <LI>Miscellanous bugs removed; some colors changed to adapt to different Emacs versions. <LI>Fixed some remaining incompatibilities with xemacs. <LI><tt>:- doc</tt> now also supported and highlighted. <LI>Eliminated need for calendar.el <LI>Added some missing library directives to fontlock list, organized this better. </ul> </ul> <p><LI>New libraries added to the system: <ul> <LI>hiord: new library which needs to be loaded in order to use higher-order call/N and P(X) syntax. Improved model for predicate abstractions. <LI>fuzzy: allows representing fuzzy information in the form or Prolog rules. <LI>use_url: allows loading a module remotely by using a WWW address of the module source code <LI>andorra: alternative search method where goals which become deterministic at run time are executed before others. <LI>iterative deepening (id): alternative search method which makes a depth-first search until a predetermined depth is reached. Complete but in general cheaper than breadth first. <LI>det_hook: allows making actions when a deterministic situation is reached. <LI>ProVRML: read VRML code and translate it into Prolog terms, and the other way around. <LI>io_alias_redirection: change where stdin/stdout/stderr point to from within Ciao programs. <LI>tcl_tk: an interface to Tcl/Tk programs. <LI>tcl_tk_obj: object-based interface to Tcl/Tk graphical objects. <LI>CiaoPP: options to interface with the CiaoPP Prolog preprocessor. </ul> <p><LI>Some libraries greatly improved: <ul> <LI>WebDB: utilities to create WWW-based database interfaces. <LI>Improved java interface implementation (this forced renaming some interface primitives). <LI>User-transparent persistent predicate database revamped: <ul> <LI>Implemented passerta_fact/1 (asserta_fact/1). <LI>Now it is never necessary to explicitly call init_persdb, a call to initialize_db is only needed after dynamically defining facts of persistent_dir/2. Thus, pcurrent_fact/1 predicate eliminated. <LI>Facts of persistent predicates included in the program code are now included in the persistent database when it is created. They are ignored in successive executions. <LI>Files where persistent predicates reside are now created inside a directory named as the module where the persistent predicates are defined, and are named as F_A* for predicate F/A. <LI>Now there are two packages: persdb and &apos;persdb/ll&apos; (for low level). In the first, the standard builtins asserta_fact/1, assertz_fact/1, and retract_fact/1 are replaced by new versions which handle persistent data predicates, behaving as usual for normal data predicates. In the second package, predicates with names starting with &apos;p&apos; are defined, so that there is not overhead in calling the standard builtins. <LI>Needed declarations for persistent_dir/2 are now included in the packages. </ul> <p><LI>SQL now works with mysql. <LI>system: expanded to contain more predicates which act as interface to the underlying system / operating system. </ul> <p><LI>Other libraries improved: <ul> <LI>xref: creates cross-references among Prolog files. <LI>concurrency: new predicates to create new concurrent predicates on-the-fly. <LI>sockets: bugs corrected. <LI>objects: concurrent facts now properly recognized. <LI>fast read/write: bugs corrected. <LI>Added &apos;webbased&apos;
