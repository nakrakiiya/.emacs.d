This describes the installation procedure for the Ciao system, including libraries and manuals, from a <em>source</em> distribution. This applies primarily to Unix-type systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, SunOS, etc.). However, the sources can also be compiled if so desired on Windows systems -- see <a href="#Installation and compilation under Windows">Installation and compilation under Windows</a> for details.<p>If you find any problems during installation, please refer to <a href="#Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)">Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)</a>. <a class="idx_anchor" id="0" href="ciaocoindex.html#troubleshooting"></a> See also <a href="BeyondInstall.html#Downloading new versions">Downloading new versions</a> and <a href="BeyondInstall.html#Reporting bugs">Reporting bugs</a>.<p><div id="Un*x installation summary"><h2>Un*x installation summary</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="1" href="ciaocoindex.html#installation, Un*x, summary"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="2" href="ciaocoindex.html#installation, Mac OS X, summary"></a> <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended that you read the full installation instructions (specially if the installation will be shared by different architectures). However, in many cases it suffices to follow this summary:<p><ol> <p><LI>Uncompress and unpackage (using <a class="idx_anchor" id="3" href="ciaoglindex.html#gunzip"><tt>gunzip</tt></a> and <tt>tar -xpf</tt>) the distribution. This will put everything in a new directory whose name reflects the Ciao version.<p><LI>Type <tt>./ciaosetup configure</tt>. This will autodetect and configure the system for your specific platform. If you need more control about what configure does, just add the option <tt>--help</tt> to see more arguments.<p>The option <tt>--menu</tt> show a menu with configurable options. You must follow the instructions that appears on it.<p>Note that the <a class="idx_anchor" id="4" href="ciaoglindex.html#GNU">GNU</a> implementation of the <a class="idx_anchor" id="5" href="ciaoglindex.html#make">make</a> Un*x command is used internally in some specific parts.

If this or next steps stop right away with <a class="idx_anchor" id="7" href="ciaoglindex.html#make"><tt>make</tt></a> error messages it is probably an older version and you need to install <tt>gmake</tt>.<p><LI>Type <tt>./ciaosetup build</tt>. This will build executables and compile libraries.<p><LI>Type <tt>./ciaosetup install</tt>. This will install everything in the specified directories.<p><LI>The system will do the right modifications in your startup scripts.

</pre> <p><strong>Note</strong>: while this is recognized by the terminal shell, and therefore by the text-mode Emacs which comes with Mac OS X, the Aqua native Emacs 21 does not recognize that initialization. It is thus necessary, at this moment, to set manually the Ciao shell (ciaosh) and Ciao library location by hand. This can be done from the Ciao menu within Emacs after a Ciao file has been loaded. We believe that the reason is that Mac OS X does not actually consult the per-user initialization files on startup. It should also be possible to put the right initializations in the .emacs file using the <tt>setenv</tt> function of Emacs-lisp, as in<p><pre>(setenv &quot;CIAOLIB&quot; &quot;&lt;v&gt;libroot&lt;/v&gt;/ciao&quot;)

</pre> <p></ul>  <p>If you are installing Ciao globally in a multi-user machine, make sure that you instruct all users to do the same. If you are the system administrator, the previous steps can be done once and for all, and globally for all users by including the lines above in the central startup scripts (e.g., in Linux <a class="idx_anchor" id="22" href="ciaoglindex.html#/etc/bashrc"><tt>/etc/bashrc</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="23" href="ciaoglindex.html#/etc/csh.login"><tt>/etc/csh.login</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="24" href="ciaoglindex.html#/etc/csh.cshrc"><tt>/etc/csh.cshrc</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="25" href="ciaoglindex.html#/etc/skel"><tt>/etc/skel</tt></a>, <a class="idx_anchor" id="26" href="ciaoglindex.html#/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl"><tt>/usr/share/emacs/.../lisp/site-init.pl</tt></a>, etc.).<p><LI>Finally, if the (freely available) <a class="idx_anchor" id="27" href="ciaoglindex.html#emacs"><tt>emacs</tt></a> editor/environment is not installed in your system, we <em>highly recommend</em> that you also install it at this point (see <a href="#Un*x full installation instructions">Un*x full installation instructions</a> for instructions). While it is easy to use Ciao with any editor of your choice, the Ciao distribution includes a very powerful <a class="idx_anchor" id="28" href="ciaocoindex.html#development environment"></a> <em>application development environment</em> which is based on <a class="idx_anchor" id="29" href="ciaoglindex.html#emacs"><tt>emacs</tt></a> and which enables, e.g., source-level debugging, syntax coloring, context-sensitive on-line help, etc.<p><LI>You may want now want to check your installation (see <a href="#Checking for correct installation on Un*x">Checking for correct installation on Un*x</a>) and read the documentation, which is stored in <tt>DOCDIR</tt> (copied from <tt>CIAOSRC/doc/reference</tt>) and can be easily accessed as explained in that same section. There are special &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; sections at the beginning of the manual.<p><LI>If you have any problems you may want to check the rest of the instructions. The system can be <em>uninstalled</em> by typing <tt>./ciaosetup uninstall</tt>. <a class="idx_anchor" id="30" href="ciaocoindex.html#uninstalling"></a> <p></ol> <p> </div><div id="Un*x full installation instructions"><h2>Un*x full installation instructions</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="31" href="ciaocoindex.html#installation, Un*x, full instructions"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="32" href="ciaocoindex.html#installation, Mac OS X, full instructions"></a> <p><ol> <p><LI><strong>Uncompress and unpackage:</strong> (using <a class="idx_anchor" id="33" href="ciaoglindex.html#gunzip"><tt>gunzip</tt></a> and <tt>tar -xpf</tt>) <a class="idx_anchor" id="34" href="ciaocoindex.html#tar"></a> the distribution in a suitable directory. This will create a new directory called <tt>ciao-X.Y</tt>, where <tt>X.Y</tt> is the version number of the distribution. The <tt>-p</tt> option in the <a class="idx_anchor" id="35" href="ciaoglindex.html#tar"><tt>tar</tt></a> command ensures that the relative dates of the files in the package are preserved, which is needed for correct operation of the Makefiles.<p><LI><strong>Select installation options:</strong> Run the <tt>./ciaosetup configure</tt> command and answer the questions that appears in the menu. The meaning of some important options in the menu is as follows:<p><ul> <p>% <LI><tt>CIAOSRC</tt>: directory where the sources are % stored. <a class="idx_anchor" id="36" href="ciaocoindex.html#source directory"></a> <p><LI><tt>BINROOT</tt>: directory where the Ciao executables will go. For example, if <tt>BINROOT=/usr/local/bin</tt>, then the Ciao <a class="idx_anchor" id="37" href="ciaoglindex.html#compiler">compiler</a> (<a class="idx_anchor" id="38" href="ciaoglindex.html#ciaoc"><tt>ciaoc</tt></a>) will be stored at <tt>/usr/local/bin/ciaoc</tt>. Actually, it will be a link to <tt>ciaoc-</tt><em>VersionNumber</em>. This applies also to other executables below and is done so that several versions of Ciao can coexist on the same machine. Note that the <em>version installed latest</em> will be the one started by default when typing <tt>ciao</tt>, <tt>ciaoc</tt>, etc. <a class="idx_anchor" id="39" href="ciaocoindex.html#binary directory"></a> <p><LI><tt>LIBROOT</tt>: directory where the <a class="idx_anchor" id="40" href="ciaoglindex.html#run-time libraries">run-time libraries</a> will be installed. <a class="idx_anchor" id="41" href="ciaocoindex.html#library directory"></a> The Ciao installation procedure will create a new subdirectory <tt>ciao</tt> below <tt>LIBROOT</tt> and a subdirectory below this one for each Ciao version installed. For example, if <tt>LIBROOT=/usr/local/lib</tt> and you have Ciao version <tt>x.y</tt>, then the libraries will be installed under <tt>/usr/local/lib/ciao/ciao-x.y</tt>. This allows you to install <a class="idx_anchor" id="42" href="ciaoglindex.html#site-specific programs">site-specific programs</a> under <tt>/usr/local/lib/ciao</tt> and they will not be overwritten if a new version of Ciao is installed. It also again allows having several Ciao versions installed simultaneously.<p><LI><tt>DOCDIR</tt>: directory where the <a class="idx_anchor" id="43" href="ciaoglindex.html#manuals">manuals</a> will be installed. It is often convenient if this directory is accessible via <a class="idx_anchor" id="44" href="ciaoglindex.html#WWW">WWW</a> (<tt>DOCDIR=/home/httpd/html/ciao</tt>, or something like that).<p></ul> <p>For network-based installations, <a class="idx_anchor" id="45" href="ciaocoindex.html#installation, network based"></a> it is of <em>utmost importance</em> that the configured paths be reachable in all the networked machines. Different machines with different architectures can share the same physical source directory during installation, since compilations for different architectures take place in dedicated subdirectories. Also, different machines/architectures can share the same <tt>LIBROOT</tt> directory (<tt>LIBROOT</tt> is configured in the menu). This saves space since the architecture-independent libraries will be shared. See <a href="#Multiarchitecture support">Multiarchitecture support</a> below.<p><LI><strong>Compile Ciao:</strong> At the ciao top level directory type <tt>./ciaosetup build</tt>.<p>This will:<p><ul> <p><LI>Build an <a class="idx_anchor" id="46" href="ciaoglindex.html#engine">engine</a> in <tt>$(CIAOSRC)/bin/$(CIAOARCH)</tt>, where <tt>$(CIAOARCH)</tt> depends on the architecture.

Only the engine and some small parts of the libraries (those written in <a class="idx_anchor" id="53" href="ciaoglindex.html#C">C</a>) differ from one architecture to the other. Standard Ciao code compiles into <a class="idx_anchor" id="54" href="ciaoglindex.html#bytecode object files">bytecode object files</a> (<tt>.po</tt>) and/or <a class="idx_anchor" id="55" href="ciaoglindex.html#executables">executables</a> which are portable among machines of different architecture, provided there is an executable engine accessible in every such machine. See more details below under <a href="#Multiarchitecture support">Multiarchitecture support</a>.<p> <LI><strong>Check compilation:</strong> If the above steps have been satisfactorily finished, the compiler has compiled itself and all the distribution modules, and very probably everything is fine.<p><LI><strong>Install Ciao:</strong> To install Ciao in the directories selected in the configuration script during step 2 above, type <tt>./ciaosetup install</tt>.

Also, the Ciao libraries (installed in <tt>LIBROOT</tt>, which contain also the engines) and the actual binaries (installed in <tt>BINROOT</tt>) can themselves be shared on several machines with different architectures, saving disk space.<p>For example, assume that the compiler is installed as:<p><tt>/usr/local/share/bin/ciaoc</tt> <p>and the libraries are installed under<p><tt>/usr/local/share/lib</tt> <p>Assume also that the <tt>/usr/local/share</tt> directory is mounted on, say, a number of <a class="idx_anchor" id="121" href="ciaoglindex.html#Linux">Linux</a> and a number of <a class="idx_anchor" id="122" href="ciaoglindex.html#Solaris">Solaris</a> boxes. In order for <tt>ciaoc</tt> to run correctly on both types of machines, the following is needed:<p><ol> <p><LI>Make sure you that have done <tt>./ciaosetup install</tt> on one machine of each architecture (once for Linux and once for Solaris in our example). This recompiles and installs a new engine and any architecture-dependent parts of the libraries for each architecture. The engines will have names such as <tt>ciaoengine.LINUXi86</tt>, <tt>ciaoengine.SolarisSparc</tt>, and so on.<p><LI>In multi-architecture environments it is even more important to make sure that users make the modifications to their startup scripts using <a class="idx_anchor" id="123" href="ciaoglindex.html#&lt;v&gt;libroot&lt;/v&gt;/ciao/DOTcshrc"><tt>&lt;v&gt;libroot&lt;/v&gt;/ciao/DOTcshrc</tt></a> etc. The selection of the engine (and architecture-dependent parts of libraries) is done in these scripts by setting the environment variable <tt>CIAOARCH</tt>, using the <tt>ciao_get_arch</tt> command, which is installed automatically when installing Ciao. This will set <tt>CIAOARCH</tt> to, say, <tt>LINUXi86</tt>, <tt>SolarisSparc</tt>, respectively, and <tt>CIAOENGINE</tt> will be set to <tt>ciaoengine.</tt><em>CIAOARCH</em>.<p>However, note that this is not strictly necessary if running on only one architecture: if <tt>CIAOARCH</tt> is not set (i.e., undefined), the Ciao executables will look simply for <tt>ciaoengine</tt>, which is always a link to the latest engine installed in the libraries. But including the initialization files provided has the advantage of setting also paths for the manuals, etc.<p></ol> <p></div><div id="Installation and compilation under Windows"><h2>Installation and compilation under Windows</h2> <p>There are two possibilities in order to install Ciao on Windows machines:<p><ul> <p><LI>Installing from the Windows <em>precompiled</em> distribution. This is the easiest since it requires no compilation and is highly recommended. This is described in <a href="InstallWin32bin.html">Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution</a>.<p><LI>Installing the standard Ciao (Un*x) system source distribution and compiling it under Windows. This is somewhat more complex and currently requires the (freely available) Cygnus Win32 development libraries --described below.<p></ul> <p><a class="idx_anchor" id="124" href="ciaocoindex.html#installation, Windows, from sources"></a> <a class="idx_anchor" id="125" href="ciaocoindex.html#compiling, Win32"></a> In order to compile Ciao for Win32 environments you need to have the (public domain) <a class="idx_anchor" id="126" href="ciaocoindex.html#Cygnus Win32"><em>Cygnus Win32</em></a> and development libraries installed in your system. Compilation should be performed preferably under Windows NT-type systems.<p><ul> <p><LI>Thus, the first step, if Cygnus Win32 is not installed in your system, is to download it (from, e.g., <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32">http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32</a>) and install it. The compilation process also requires that the executables <tt>rm.exe</tt>, <tt>sh.exe</tt>, and <tt>uname.exe</tt> from the Cygnus distribution be copied under <tt>/bin</tt> prior to starting the process (if these executables are not available under <tt>/bin</tt> the compilation process will produce a number of errors and eventually stop prematurely).<p><LI>Assuming all of the above is installed, type <tt>./ciaosetup allwin32</tt>. This will compile both the engine and the Ciao libraries. In this process, system libraries that are normally linked dynamically under Un*x (i.e., those for which <tt>.so</tt> dynamically loadable files are generated) are linked statically into the engine (this is done instead of generating <tt>.dll</tt>s because of a limitation in the current version of the Cygnus Win32 environment). No actual installation is made at this point, i.e., this process leaves things in a similar state as if you had just downloaded and uncompressed the precompiled distribution. Thus, in order to complete the installation you should now:<p><LI>Follow now the instructions in <a href="InstallWin32bin.html">Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution</a>.<p></ul> <p>A further note regarding the executables generated by the Ciao compiler and top-level: the same considerations given in <a href="InstallWin32bin.html">Installing Ciao from a Win32 binary distribution</a> apply regarding <tt>.bat</tt> files, etc. However, in a system in which Cygnus Win32 is installed these executables can also be used in a very simple way. In fact, the executables can be run as in Un*x by simply typing their name at the <a class="idx_anchor" id="127" href="ciaoglindex.html#bash"><tt>bash</tt></a> shell command line without any associated <tt>.bat</tt> files. This only requires that the <a class="idx_anchor" id="128" href="ciaoglindex.html#bash"><tt>bash</tt></a> shell which comes with Cygnus Win32 be installed and accessible: simply, make sure that <a class="idx_anchor" id="129" href="ciaoglindex.html#/bin/sh.exe"><tt>/bin/sh.exe</tt></a> exists.<p></div><div id="Porting to currently unsupported operating systems"><h2>Porting to currently unsupported operating systems</h2> <p>If you would like to port Ciao to a currently unsupported platform, there are several issues to take into account. The main one is to get the <em>engine</em> to compile in that platform, i.e., the C code under the <tt>engine</tt> directory. The procedure currently followed by Ciao to decide the various flags needed to compile is as follows:<p><ul> <p><LI>The shell script <tt>$(CIAOSRC)/etc/ciao_get_arch</tt> is executed; it returns a string describing the operating system and the processor architecture (e.g., LINUXi86, SolarisSparc, SolarisAlpha, etc.). You should make sure it returns a correct (and meaningful) string for your setup. This string is used trhoughout the compilation to create several architecture-dependant flags.<p><LI>In the directory <tt>$(CIAOSRC)/makefile-sysdep</tt> there are files called mkf-&lt;OS&gt;&lt;ARCH&gt; for every combination of operating system and architecture in which Ciao is know to (and how to) compile. They set several flags regarding, for example, whether to use or not threads, which threads library to use, the optimization flags to use, the compiler, linker, and it also sets separately the architecture name (ARCHNAME variable) and the operating system (OSNAME). You should create a new mkf file for your machine, starting from the one which is closest to you.<p><LI>Most times the porting problems happen in the use of locks and threads. You can either disable them, or have a look at the files <tt>$(CIAOSRC)/engine/locks.h</tt> and <tt>$(CIAOSRC)/engine/threads.h</tt>. If you know how to implement native (assembler) locks for your architecture, enable HAVE_NATIVE_SLOCKS for your architecture and add the definitions. Otherwise, if you have library-based locks, enable them. The mechanism in <tt>threads.h</tt> is similar.<p></ul> <p> Once a working engine is achieved, it should be possible to continue with the standard installation procedure, which will try to use a completely static version of the standalone compiler (<tt>ciaoc.sta</tt> in the <tt>ciaoc</tt> directory) to compile the interactive top-level (<a class="idx_anchor" id="130" href="ciaoglindex.html#ciaosh"><tt>ciaosh</tt></a>) and a new version of the standalone compiler (<a class="idx_anchor" id="131" href="ciaoglindex.html#ciaoc"><tt>ciaoc</tt></a>). These in turn should be able to compile the Ciao libraries. You may also need to look at some libraries (such as, for example, <a class="idx_anchor" id="132" href="ciaoglindex.html#sockets"><tt>sockets</tt></a>) which contain C code. If you do succeed in porting to a platform that is currently unsupported please send the <a class="idx_anchor" id="133" href="ciaoglindex.html#mkf-CIAOARCH"><tt>mkf-CIAOARCH</tt></a> and any patches to <A HREF="mailto:ciao@clip.dia.fi.upm.es">&lt;ciao@clip.dia.fi.upm.es&gt;</A>, and we will include them (with due credit, of course) in the next distribution.<p> </div><div id="Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)"><h2>Troubleshooting (nasty messages and nifty workarounds)</h2> <a class="idx_anchor" id="134" href="ciaocoindex.html#troubleshooting"></a> <p>The following a list of common installation problems reported by users:<p><ul> <p> <LI><strong>Problem:</strong> Compilation errors appear when trying a new installation/compilation after the previous one was aborted (e.g., because of errors).<p><strong>Possible reason and solution:</strong> It is a good idea to clean up any leftovers from the previous compilation using <tt>./ciaosetup engclean</tt> before restarting the installation or compilation process.<p><LI><strong>Problem:</strong> <p>During engine compilation, messages such as the following appear: <tt>tasks.c:102:PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS undeclared (first use of this function)</tt>.<p><strong>Possible reason and solution:</strong> <p>Your (Linux?) system does not have (yet) the <a class="idx_anchor" id="135" href="ciaoglindex.html#Posix threads">Posix threads</a> library installed.
